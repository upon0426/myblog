## This my blog I made for the first time
URL: https://myblog-eecb8.web.app/

## What I have implemented

There are 5 function:

- cread a new blog
- delete a exsiting blog
- edit a exsitng blog
- see the detail of a blog
- see a list of the blog

and used firestore as mockserver
We studied there knowledg from lecture of Build@mercari

## As for extra credit
- I used webpack
- I wish the css is tought to be cool

## What I couldn't do

- There are still many parts that need to be implemented. I wrote them on Issue.

- I really wanted to make another website using React. I wish I will get the oppotunity soon.
